Introduction to python
------------------------------
Python Introductions
=================
Python 
======
>> What Is Python ?
	Python is a programming language that is Interpreted, Object Oriented, and considered to be High-level too.

Python is one of the easiest yet most useful programming languages   

Python is a Open Source High level object oriented programming language.

Python is as known as the GPL (General Purpose programming Language)

Python is mainly used to develop the following different types of applications:
	a) Windows APP  (python + Tkinter packages)

	b) Web App Develop (Django + Flask)

	c) Data Scientist + Data Analyst (Pandas,numpy,seaborn,scipy, sklearn,matplotlib)

	d) Network Tool Automation Developer (Netmiko, Paramiko, Socket)
	
	e) Testing Tool Automation Developer (Selinium) (Web testing) It's as script in Mobile testing also.

	f)  AI Tools developer (NLP)


Python Language Features
========================
Python is simple and easy to learn programming language.

Python supports many built in keywords (keywords which are also known as reserved words)

Python also supports many libraries and modules built in (packages).

Python is OS independent.  You can install python in Windows, Linux , Mac.

Python is an OSS (Open Source Software), it means we can download and install python freely along with the source code of the language libraries.

Python when compared to java it is 10+ times faster, for example:

	.java			                .py

	 |				|
	javac			         interpretor
	 |				|
	.class			            output
	|
	jvm
	|
	ouput

Python can be downloaded from the python.org web site

Python Was invented By a Person called Guido Van Rossum in the 1994-95.(14)

There are many versions of python available like: 2008  -2022  (14)

	python 2.7...2.8..3.0......3.1,,,,,,,3.2,3.3,3.4,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8,3.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.10,3.10.1, 3.10.2,  3.10.3, 3.10.4................

python 3.12.5 latest


Once we download and install python following tools are also installed

	a) Python Shell		: Python Shell is just a shell prompt which is used to give single line instructions at a time

	b) Python IDLE		: Python IDLE which is mainly used to give and develop python scripts

	c) Python Help Docs

	d) Python Interpretor		: It is used to convert the python instructions into machine level code.

>>> print("Welcome to Python coding")
Welcome to Python coding
>>> print(120+44)
164
>>> print(10/3)

Python IDLE
===========
It is known as Integrated Developement Env.

IDLE is mainly used by the python developer, to develop the python programs.

A program always contains 3 components:
	a) INPUT
	b) LOGIC
	c) OUTPUT

python simple to and execute using IDLE

Apart from built in IDLE we also can devlelop the python script by using the following different editors like:
	a) pycharm	(comminuty or professional)

	b) Jupyter

	c) Spyder

	d) Visual source Code
Python is mainly Object Oriented and high level programming language.

Python Features
==============
1) Python is simple and easy to learn
2) Python provides rich set built in libraries as packages.
3) Python also comes with many keywords.
4) Python is also an OS independent 
5) Python is faster in executions compared to other programming languages

Exampe:
	.java			.py
	  |			 |
	 javac			interpretor
	  |			 |
	.class			machine/op
	  |
	jvm
	 |
	machine/op

In todays current scenario python programs run 10+ times faster than other language programs.

Programming means grouping set of different instructions together, for performing some particular tasks.

To give or code the python instructions we need an IDE(Integrated Development Env), some of the other important
IDE's are:
	a) pycharm (community, professional)
	b) jupyter
	c) Spyder
